# EnvisionAI: Using Exisiting CCTV Infrastructrure for Crime Detection, Crowd Management and Cleanliness

# Problem statement
Develop an AI-based video surveillance system to detect potential criminal activities from existing security camera footage. Keeping records of critical information about the incident, assesses its nature and risk level, and communicates real-time alerts to authorities via APIs to facilitates swift response during disasters to stop the situation from escalating, enhancing overall situational awareness and public safety. Man-made disasters caused by human actions result in significant damage, destruction, and disruption. These disasters can be intentional, such as acts of terrorism, or unintentional, like industrial accidents.
Mumbai Terror Attacks (2008): Co-ordinated terrorist attacks in Mumbai targeted various locations, including a railway station, hotels, and a Jewish community center. This incident highlighted the need for advanced security measures and swift response strategies. Thus, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to prevent, respond to, and mitigate the impact of such events.
