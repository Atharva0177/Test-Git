# EnvisionAI: Using Exisiting CCTV Infrastructrure for Crime Detection, Crowd Management and Cleanliness

A Smart system that can help detect criminal activities using existing security cameras. This system will use advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning Algorithms to spot potential crimes as they happen and send alerts to the authorities via a mobile app, allowing faster response from authorities during times of disaster/ preventing a disaster.
Your proposed smart system that can detect criminal activities using existing security cameras is a promising solution for enhancing public safety and preventing disasters. By leveraging the power of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning Algorithms, the system can proactively detect and respond to criminal activities in real-time, allowing for swift action by authorities during emergencies.
The system can be seamlessly integrated with existing security cameras, which can identify potential crimes as they occur and send alerts to the authorities through a mobile app. This ensures rapid response during emergencies and the prevention of disasters, making it an essential asset for law enforcement and security agencies.
While AI and machine learning algorithms can be effective in detecting criminal activities, they are not perfect and can sometimes produce false positives. Therefore, it is important to use these technologies in conjunction with human intelligence (Human Validation Mechanism) and expertise to ensure the best possible outcomes. proposed smart system has the potential to be a game-changer in enhancing security, safeguarding communities, and improving overall safety in various settings.
